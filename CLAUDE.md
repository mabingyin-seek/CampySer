# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an empty repository named "CampySer" with no existing codebase structure. The directory is completely empty except for this CLAUDE.md file.

## Development Environment

Since this is a new project, the following will need to be established:
- No package.json, requirements.txt, or other dependency files exist
- No build system or testing framework is configured
- No linting or type checking tools are set up
- No CI/CD configuration exists

## Getting Started

This is a blank canvas project. Before adding code, determine:
1. What programming language and framework to use
2. What build tools and dependency management system is needed
3. What testing framework should be implemented
4. What linting and code quality tools should be added

## Notes for Future Development

Since this repository is empty, any new code added should include:
- Proper documentation
- Testing framework setup
- Build configuration
- Development environment setup instructions
